        <p>The peacock is the most beautiful bird in the world. It is a tall but slender bird with a long feather tail.
            The bird has different shades of blue and green feathers. Peacocks can spread out their long feathers like
            an umbrella revealing hundreds of eye-like patterns.

            Their body can weigh up to 5 to 6 kg, while their length from the tip of the beak to the end of the train is
            190 to 230 cm. The head, neck and breast of the peacock are of royal blue colour.The color of the peacock is
            dark greenish-brown and blue. A peacock has beautiful and colorful feathers. It has dots like the moon on
            its long feathers. The peacock has two legs, two eyes, a long and thin neck, a beak, a beautiful crest and
            long tail feathers. Most noteworthy, the bird is famous for its beautiful vibrant colours. The Peacock is
            popular for its spectacular beauty. It certainly has a hypnotic appearance. Watching it dance during the
            Monsoon season is a great pleasure experience.

        <p>Peacocks are non-fussy omnivores and will eat most plant foods such as seeds, grains, berries, vegetables and
            fruits as well as insects, arthropods, small lizards, snakes, frogs and rodents. They require a high-protein
            diet to keep their feathers healthy and generally have strong appetites.The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus)
            has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a
            little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the
            "tail", also known as a "train".
        </p>

        <p>There are two familiar peacock species. The blue peacock lives in India and Sri Lanka, while the green
            peacock is found in Java and Myanmar (Burma). A more distinct and little-known species, the Congo peacock,
            inhabits African rain forests.
        </p>

        <p>One of the most impressive scenes in the world of birds is a peacock displaying its impressive, iridescent
            feathers, technically known as its train
        </p>

        <p>There are three species of peafowl. The two most recognizable species are the blue, or Indian, peacock (Pavo
            cristatus) and the green, or Javanese, peacock (Pavo muticus). The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) was
            discovered in 1936.
